# Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard
## Problem Statement:
Despite a healthy and growing loan portfolio with a high repayment rate and low delinquency rate, the bank faces several challenges:-
- Lack of diversification: The bank's loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in the commercial sector (51%). This concentration exposes the bank to increased risk if the commercial sector experiences a downturn.

- Limited product offerings: The bank primarily offers traditional loan products, such as commercial and residential loans. This limits the bank's ability to attract new customers and grow its market share.

- Emerging opportunities: The bank is not actively pursuing emerging opportunities in high-growth industries, such as renewable energy and healthcare. This limits the bank's potential for future growth.

## These challenges could potentially lead to:
* Reduced profitability
* Increased risk exposure
* Missed market opportunities
* The bank needs to implement strategies to address these challenges and ensure its long-term financial sustainability
* The bank loan analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the bank's loan portfolio. 
* The dashboard provides insights into the number of loan applications, the total funded amount, the total amount received, the total revolving balance, and the total number of accounts.

## Key insights:
- The bank's loan portfolio is growing steadily, with the total funded amount increasing from $256.24 million in 2007 to $511.11 million in 2023.

* The dashboard also shows that the bank is making more loans to small businesses.
